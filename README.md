# Laravel Training

I am using this oportuniy to become as much familiar as possible with the latest Laravel, which comes with amazing features to help  building great application a lot faster and robust.
Each branch will be a different project. Though, they're going to be api based as it will prepare me for when I am working in Company's App.
